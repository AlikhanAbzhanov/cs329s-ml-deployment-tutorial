# CS329s Machine Learning Model Deployment Tutorial

> What is in here?

Code and files to go along with [CS329s machine learning model deployment tutorial](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/syllabus.html).

> What will I end up with?

If you go through the steps below without fail, you should end up with a Streamlit-powered web application for classifying images of food.

> What do I need?

* GCP account
* gcloud CLI utitly
* gsutil is also helpful 
* trained machine learning models, our service uses an image classification model on a number of different classes of food from Food101 dataset. (see the notebook)

**Warning:** Using Google Cloud services costs money. If you don't have credits (you get $300USD when you first sign up), you will be charged. Delete and shutdown your work when finished to avoid charges.

> Okay, I'm in, how can I use it?

* clone the repo
* cd into food-vision
* make virtualenv 
* activate env
* pip install -r requirements.txt 
* streamlit run app.py
* navigate to local host where Streamlit app lives
  * Note: Streamlit app will break unless, you've got the right GCP setup...

> What do all the files in `food-vision` do?

* TODO: list what each file does...

> Where can I learn all of this?
